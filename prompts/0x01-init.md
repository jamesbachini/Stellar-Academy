Create a react website which displays a interactive flow chart. The flow chart should be a individual component so it can be moved easily to another site.

Use the Reactflow library @xyflow/react
More info here: https://reactflow.dev/api-reference

The structure for the flow chart is in ./Structure.md

There should be buttons on the right hand side with icons and then contract developers, frontend developers, entrepreneurs & investors

The background should be dark. And each box in the flow chart should have rounded corners and the smooth lines showing the direction of flow.

Different colors can be used for different tracks. Make sure it looks visually appealing.

When a user clicks frontend dev the chart should change to that flow chart with all the information tailored to frontend developers.

Don't display the links but let the user click off and it open a new tab.
